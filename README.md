# ELECTRON-4-PHP
An easiest way to use php in electron.
- *For now its only supports MAC. And windows and Linux will be supported if php will be installed. I invite openly everyone to contribute in this project and make it working in window and linux also.*

**Clone and run for a quick way to see Electron4PHP in action.**
```
git clone https://github.com/AJ-TechSoul/ELECTRON-4-PHP/
cd ELECTRON-4-PHP
npm install
npm start
```

**Use this app along with the [Electron API Demos](http://electron.atom.io/#get-started) app for API code examples to help you get started.**

A basic Electron4PHP application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.php` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

## For macOS Monteray or later users

macOS has removed the default PHP instance from 12.0 onwards. Please see this link to re-install it https://github.com/shivammathur/homebrew-php
